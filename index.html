        <br>My dreams burned bright, fueling my passion to break through barriers. Driven by love for my family and a fierce belief in myself, I've pushed past limits that once seemed impossible. 
        <br>At a young age, I'm proof that hard work and determination can transform any situation. My journey isn't just about personal success—it's about showing the world that with courage and persistence, anything is possible.

    <h2>My Goals for Backend Engineering</h2>

    <P>Stepping into the world of technology through Altschool Africa, I'm excited to become a backend engineer who builds the invisible magic behind websites and apps. 
        <br>I'll learn how to create the behind-the-scenes systems that make digital experiences work smoothly. My journey will focus on JavaScript, a powerful programming language that helps me build the brain of websites and applications. 
        <br>I'll discover how to create pathways for data to move, store information securely, and make sure everything runs quickly and safely. From understanding how websites talk to databases to creating systems that handle thousands of user requests, I'm ready to transform my passion into real-world technological solutions.
